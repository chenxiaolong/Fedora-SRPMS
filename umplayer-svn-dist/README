The 'create_rpm.sh' and 'umplayer.spec' files allow UMPlayer SVN to build properly
on Fedora and openSUSE. The spec file cannot be built directory. Instead, the two
files should replace those from the SVN trunk.

After replacing the files, run 'create_rpm.sh' to generate the RPM files.

The following RPM's are generated:

 - umplayer
 - umplayer-debuginfo
 - umplayer-lang
 - umplayer-themes

The RPMS can be found in the ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/`uname -m`/ directory. An SRPM for
the build SVN revision can be found in the ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS/ directory.
